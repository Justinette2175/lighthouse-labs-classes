## Quick disclaimer about callbacks

The callbacks logic might bend your brain in seemingly unnatural ways (definitely did mine back in the day!). Then again it might not.

But if you find yourself a bit stunned, trust it's the kind of mental gynmastics that gets smoother over time. It might not click right away, but it surely will as you are exposed to more and more use cases. Don't sweat it.

## Our task for today

Our boss has asked us to simulate a washing machine.

It should:

1. Wash clothes for a certain number of spins
2. Let us know when it is done (ex. Screaming, Beeping, we pick the ringtone!)

## Step by step

- [ ] Let's implement a simple wash clothes function that does 10 spins and then screams "AAAAAAAAAAA"

- [ ] Letâ€™s implement a function called scream to store the scream itself, so we can scream whenever we want to and refactor initial function

- [ ] Now, let's make another washing machine that warns us the cycle is over with a loud beep

- [ ] What's the problem with this?

- [ ] What if we want to set the wash cycle to another number?

- [ ] How can we make a washing mashing where we can both pick the cycle and the ringtone?

- [ ] What if we will never really need to reuse the scream or beep functions, and we don't want to store them in variables?

- [ ] Let's instead use the double arrow notation here

- [ ] How would we modify our function so that it washes for however many spins we want, then warns us that it's done in two consecutive ways (beeping first, then screaming)?

- [ ] Can we change the order of the arguments to that function?

- [ ] So how come we can do whatever we want with all these functions?

_Next part is pretty abstract. Make sure to focus for now, and trust that it will make sense in time!_

- [ ] So far, we have never passed in any arguments to our callback function. Let's instead modify the scream function so that it now screams for twice as long as the wash cycle.

- [ ] Let's look at another example. Let's make a function that does any action we like on two numbers.

- [ ] Let's create a forEach function that takes in an array and a callback function, and performs the callback function on each item in the array, one at a time.

## What we learned

### Higher order function and callbacks!

- A callback function is a function, anonymous or not, which is passed as an argument to another function and called by that function.

- A higher order function is a function that takes in a callback function as an argument and executes it.

## Functions are First-Class Objects in Javascript

Functions are just like any other Objects in Javascript (in fact they are a type of Object :S). They can do everything that other objects can do .

Functions can be, among other things,:

- Stored in variables
- Passed as arguments to other functions
- Returned from other functions

### Double Arrow Syntax

There are multiple syntaxes to declare a function. They are mostly equivalent (for now, don't worry about the slight differences which we will cover later in the course).

```js
function scream() {
  console.log("AAAAAAAAA");
}

var scream = function () {
  console.log("AAAAAAAAA");
};

// Double Arrow Notation
var scream = () => {
  console.log("AAAAAAAAA");
};
```

### Anonymous functions

Functions that you don't need to reuse don't have to be given a name or stored in a variable in memory.
This is particularly useful for callback functions.

```js
function countToNAndDo(count, callback) {
  for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    console.log(i + 1);
  }
  callback();
}

// Anonymous function passed in as a callback
countToNAndDo(10, () => {
  console.log("AAAAAAAAAA");
});
```

### Callback functions can accept arguments too!

```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function doToTwoNumbers(a, b, callback) {
  return callback(a, b);
}

console.log(doToTwoNumbers(1, 2, sum));
// returns 3
```
